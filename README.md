# Auctionary – Full Stack Web Application

A full-stack auction management application built using a JavaScript-based backend and a Vue.js frontend.

The project follows a predefined API specification and demonstrates backend API development, database interaction, and frontend integration.

## Project Overview
Auctionary is a prototype auction platform designed with a decoupled architecture, allowing the backend API and frontend application to scale independently.

- Worked within an existing starter codebase to extend backend functionality
- Implemented auction, bid, and user management endpoints
- Integrated SQLite database interactions
- Validated requests and handled appropriate HTTP responses
- Used automated test scripts to verify API correctness

### Frontend (Vue.js)
- Built a Vue 3 frontend application using Vite
- Implemented client-side routing with Vue Router
- Managed application state using Pinia
- Integrated frontend components with backend API endpoints
- Styled the interface using Bootstrap
- Applied branding and basic UX principles
